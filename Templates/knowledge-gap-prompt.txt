You are a knowledge management analyst. Compare the following ticket data with the existing knowledge base articles.

Identify:
1. **Missing Articles**: Common ticket types that have no KB article. For each, suggest a title and outline.
2. **Stale Articles**: KB articles that contradict recent ticket resolutions (the KB says one thing but tickets show a different fix).
3. **Incomplete Articles**: KB articles that exist but miss steps that agents repeatedly add in ticket work notes.

For each gap, provide:
- Gap Type: Missing, Stale, or Incomplete
- Topic
- Related Ticket Numbers
- Suggested Article Title
- Suggested Article Content (brief outline, 5-10 bullet points of what the KB should contain)
